# Data-Cleaning
As we know data cleaning is a very important phase in data analysis. In this repo we have some data cleaning projects. Each of them is done for various datasets. 
We check these cases for datasets:
- Missing Value
- Corrupted Value
- Time format
- Data Range Error
- Duplicate Value
- Filter
- Convert Objects to Category
- Convert Category to Int for Clustering
